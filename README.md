# Introduction
Smoke detectors are very useful in the detection of smoke or fire in buildings, and so are the important parameters of safety.
So today In this project, we will make a Simple Smoke Detector Alarm Circuit without using any Microcontroller. This circuit triggers the buzzer whenever it detects smoke or fire nearby it.

This Smoke Detector Alarm circuit is designed using MQ-02 sensor and with few easily available components, like NPN transistor,
 Main part of this circuit is Gas sensor MQ-02 which is capable of detecting Smoke, LPG, Propane and Hydrogen. It can be used in different types of applications where the smoke LPG, Propane and Hydrogen gas leak detection required.

this smoke detector Circuit is designed without using any microcontrollers, so we don't required any coding . Just power up the Circuit using battery and this Circuit will start working. So in this way this smoke detector Circuit is very good safety equipment ...small and reliable, which can be easily install  anywhere.

# Working
Working of this smoke detector alarm circuit is very easy. In this project, 
we used the transistor operating properties to work with this circuit as a smoke detector.
 BC547 NPN transistor will turn on whenever it gets at least 0.70v at its base terminal. We, therefore, applied a voltage divider circuit at its base.

But before using this circuit, we must calibrate it by using a potentiometer.
 During calibration, we applied voltage just below 0.70v at the base of the transistor.
 Whenever the sensor detects smoke, it reduces its strength, because of this reduction in resistance, the voltage across the base of the transistor rises. 
Now when the voltage at the terminal of a transistor becomes greater than or equal to 0.70v, then the transistor turns on, the LED lights up, and the buzzer also starts beeping.
 And when we do not find smoke, LED and Buzzer turn off as the voltage across the base terminal of the transistor falls below 0.70v.
